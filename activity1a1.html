  Hello, my name is <span class="highlight">Tanvi Singh</span>, currently a <strong>BTECH
 CSE</strong> student at VIT Vellore. I am passionate about <strong>technology</strong>,
 creativity, and problem-solving. I believe in continuous learning and strive to improve myself every
 day. I have been an active learner ever since I can remember—participating in athletics, debating,
 and excelling academically. These experiences have helped build my confidence, resilience, and
 intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have experience in <em>various fields</em>, including <strong>web development</strong>,
 <strong>coding</strong>, and teamwork. Being part of my technical club has been
 transformative—I’ve grown from a core member to an editor and now serve as a representative. I
 continuously work to enhance my technical skills while seeking opportunities to grow. My hobbies
 include reading, writing, and experimenting with new ideas, which help fuel my creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
  I am a mathematics enthusiast with a strong passion for learning. I had the opportunity to
 participate in a debate event at Yale University and reached the state-level championship in Abacus.
 I thrive on collaboration and tackling challenges. Over time, I’ve come to deeply value
 <em>perseverance</em> and <strong>dedication</strong>, which have been crucial in shaping my
 journey.
